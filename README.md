This is personal project, collaborated with Minwoo Ju. 

We started this project at November 15, 2020 and finished at December 27, 2020.

We created the actual board game "Yacht Dice" in Unity 3D.

This is turn based multiplayer game.

Each player can role the dice for 3 times at most to get the highest score.
